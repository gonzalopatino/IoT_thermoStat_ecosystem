## 📋 CS-499 Requirements Satisfied

This ePortfolio structure addresses all CS-499 final project requirements:

### ✅ Professional Self-Assessment (`/assessment/`)
- Summarizes learning throughout the CS program
- Discusses collaboration, communication, and technical skills
- Introduces the portfolio and explains how artifacts fit together
- Aligns skills with professional goals

### ✅ Code Review (`/code-review/`)
- Video walkthrough of original artifact code
- Identification of issues and weaknesses
- Planned enhancements for each category
- Professional code review practices demonstrated

### ✅ Three Enhancement Categories

| Category | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Software Engineering & Design** | `/artifacts/software-engineering/` | Modular architecture, component design, build systems |
| **Algorithms & Data Structures** | `/artifacts/algorithms/` | Control algorithms, hysteresis, state machines |
| **Databases** | `/artifacts/database/` | Django ORM, PostgreSQL, REST API design |

### ✅ Artifact Code & Documentation
- **Original Code**: `/artifacts/original/` - Baseline code from CS-350
- **Enhanced Code**: `/artifacts/enhanced/` - Improved ESP32 firmware + Django backend
- **Supporting Assets**: `/assets/img/` and `/assets/docs/`

### ✅ Course Outcomes Addressed

1. **Employ strategies for building collaborative environments** - Documented in self-assessment
2. **Design and evaluate computing solutions** - Demonstrated in algorithm artifact
3. **Communicate effectively with diverse audiences** - Portfolio structure and narratives
4. **Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded techniques** - Software engineering artifact
5. **Develop a security mindset** - Security considerations in database artifact
